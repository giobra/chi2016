\section{Introduction}

Developing good user interfaces for web or mobile applications is a
complex and expensive endeavor. One reason is the combination of
devices, interaction modalities and workflows that need to be
supported.

Adopting Usage Centered Development practices is effective, as is
following established design principles~\cite{constantine99}. Early
prototyping~\cite{buxton07} and exploration of the 5-dimensional prototyping
space~\cite{mccurdy06} is one of the most effective techniques,
especially when paired with usability investigations based on user
testing or heuristic evaluations.

However, it requires development of prototypes that are usually
developed with certain tasks in mind, and therefore are quite
restricted in terms of depth and breadth of supported use
cases. Furthermore, usability results are always surrounded by a cloud
of uncertainty, due to subjectivity introduced by participants and
facilitators or by other contingency factors involved in the
analysis. Thus, although an effort needs to be expended to develop and
use prototypes, less than optimal results are obtained.

A designer, while conceiving and developing a solution, might benefit
from answers to seemingly simple questions that should not require a
significant investment of time and effort. Given one or more potential
solutions and some usage scenarios, interesting questions could
include: ``What are the optimal execution paths?'' or ``How many such
paths exist?'', or ``Are usage mistakes recoverable?''. At the moment,
even these straightforward questions are quite complex to answer. In
fact, they require inspection of prototypes, manual tracking of which
screens and widgets are used at which stage, and exhaustive searches.

This should not be the case, however. These answers provide important
insights to a designer, and support decisions related to benchmarking
different solutions, to identification of optimal or mistaken paths,
to assessment of suitability of a design with respect to scenarios.

In this paper we present an approach that allows designer to quickly
be able to get these kinds of answers, and present it on a case study
comparing four different web mail front ends. We have chosen this
domain because it is very well understood by readers and yet those
trivial questions lead to non trivial results.

The approach is based on UML statechart models of the user interfaces
which are automatically processed to produce \emph{interaction
  graphs}. These are then used to unfold \emph{execution traces} that
are dependent on the specific usage scenarios being considered in the
analysis. On traces several graph-theoretic computations can be
performed to produce a dhasboard of different results that provide the
answers. Except for development of models and specification of the
desired scenarios, the other steps are totally automatic; models of a
design could be developed in a matter of a couple of hours.

The contribution consists of the development of a tool that transforms
models and scenario specifications into execution traces, and the
definition of metrics that provide concise, precise and objective
measures of a design.
